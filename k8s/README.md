# DON'T USE THIS K8S CONFIGURATION IN PRODUCTION

The Kubernetes configuration files you can find in this folder are **STALE** and **NOT TESTED**.
The only containerized deployment method currently actively supported and tested are Docker (without DB, [documented here](../README.md#how-to-use-this-framework-to-create-a-map)) and Docker Compose (supports also the DB, [documented here](../CONTRIBUTING.md#production-deployment-with-docker)).
If you want to deploy a map based on OWMF on K8s please contribute by testing and improving this configuration.
